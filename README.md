Final project for SPCS AI Class Session 2

Instructions on how to run/get the project to work (kind of buggy as of now/annoying to set
up because it was made in Google colab so we'll have to fix that eventually):

1) access dataset zipfile here (download and then upload it to google drive):
         https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QZ4XVJZry5rNtjTfYmJXl2SV4dK47tL_/view?usp=sharing
         note: keep zip in the main directory and don't place in any other folder
2) run pynb in colab (you'll have to mount your drive so that the project will access and then unzip the dataset within it)
3) for the testphto part, you could either download the given testphto in this repo or upload your own (MUST be jpg file though)

yeah that's basically it
